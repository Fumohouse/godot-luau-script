# `godot-luau-script` API Reference

`godot-luau-script` provides its own library on top of bindings to Godot in order to allow custom class creation
and provide various other useful functions (e.g. `wait` and `require`).

Currently, this library is defined and documented in `definitions/luauLibTypes.part.d.lua`.
A generated page for this documentation is planned.
