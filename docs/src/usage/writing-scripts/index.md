# Writing Scripts

Since `godot-luau-script` supports most of Godot's script language
functionality, you should be able to accomplish the same things as you could
with another language like GDScript or C#.

This includes creating and extending your own classes, registering methods to be
called from Godot (e.g. through a signal), registering and connecting your own
signals, using RPCs, registering AutoLoad scripts, etc.
