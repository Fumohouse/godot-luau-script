# godot-luau-script build containers

`podman` build containers for this project, essentially a simplified version of
Godot's [build containers](https://github.com/godotengine/build-containers/) and
[scripts](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-build-scripts/).

Published releases are built using these containers and scripts.

See the [documentation](https://ksk.codeberg.page/godot-luau-script/usage/building-and-installation.html)
for usage.
