scripting language.

## Development status

godot-luau-script is currently under *probationary maintenance*.

Fumohouse, the main user of GLS, has transitioned to GDScript as the primary
language.

GLS is undergoing a gradual rework to resolve selected issues, stay up-to-date
with upstream changes, and improve ergonomics. If the project reaches an
acceptable state, it will re-enter active maintenance and be included in
Fumohouse as a secondary language.

The timing and reliability of these updates is not guaranteed. New releases may
not be published during this time.

## Recurring maintenance tasks

- Keeping up-to-date with GDExtension changes
- Areas that must be synced with Godot (`grep "! SYNC WITH"`)
