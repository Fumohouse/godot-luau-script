## Development status

godot-luau-script is currently under **limited maintenance**.

Fumohouse, the main user of GLS, will be transitioning to GDScript. GLS will
likely be used in the future if/when sandboxing is required.

GLS may receive sporadic updates to resolve selected issues and keep it
up-to-date with upstream Godot/Luau changes. The timing and reliability of these
updates is not guaranteed. New releases may not be published.

Contributions are still accepted and will be reviewed. If you would like to
become a maintainer of this project, feel free to reach out by filing an issue.
Outstanding tasks are listed in `TASKS.md` for your reference.
